# Mixed-ANOVA-and-Multilevel-Modeling
-  I completed this project as a capstone with Dr. Honglang Wang to get a better understanding of multilevel modeling and mixed-ANOVA analysis while using R.
- Click on the "Presentation.pdf" to see the presenation of the problem. 
- Click on the "Mixed_Design_Anova.pdf" to see the RMarkdown document, so you can see my code and thought process. 

## Summary and Actionable Insights
- Multileveling modeling does a better job of handling missing data than mixed-ANOVA.
- Multileveling modeling treates time as a continuos variable which is helpful in analysis. 
- In short, multileveling modeling was a better model and fit the data better than mixed-ANOVA. 

## What did I learn?
- Making beautiful graphs with ggplot2.
- Cleaning data with tidyverse.
- How to use LaTeX for mathematical notation.
- How to check for outliers and how that impacts the analysis.
- The statistics and theory behiend mixed-ANOVA analysis.
- The statistics and theory behiend multilevel modleing.
